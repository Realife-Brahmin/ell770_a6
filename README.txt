1. FOR EVALUATION: The PDF may be used. The code archive may be ignored.
2. a6_01_main.mlx can only be used to solve q1 and q2. For q3, go to a5 and follow the README instructions in README_for_solving_a6q1.txt

Note:
1. cart2polar and polar2cart functions (written by me) are NOT the same as the MATLAB native implementations cart2pol and pol2cart.
2. sc2ph.m and ph2sc.m are borrowed from [this MATLAB Central file](t.ly/94zG). It is easy to write your own implementations, however.
